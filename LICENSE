# Authentic Open License (AOL)
Version 1.0

Preamble
---------
The Authentic Open License (AOL) is designed to maximize openness while ensuring authenticity.
It grants nearly unrestricted freedom to use, modify, and redistribute software, while requiring attribution
when unmodified code remains. Unlike other open source licenses, AOL prevents superficial changes
from erasing authorship and ensures that the software always remains under this same license.

This license does not restrict private, local use. The rules regarding attribution, modification,
and AOL licensing apply only when the software is shared, distributed, or otherwise made accessible
outside the local environment.


By using this software, you agree to the following terms.

1. Grant of Rights
-------------------
You are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell this software
and derivative works, subject to the terms of this license.

2. Attribution Requirement
--------------------------
- If you redistribute this software in unmodified or minimally modified form, you must provide clear
  attribution to the original author.
- Minimal modification includes trivial edits such as:
  - Renaming functions, variables, file names, or classes **does not count as modification**, unless it results in
    substantial performance improvement or resolves significant compatibility issues.
  - Adjusting whitespace, formatting, or comments.
  - Rearranging code without introducing meaningful new logic.
- Significant modification is defined as altering at least **35% of the functional logic**, measured objectively by:
  - Comparing the abstract syntax tree (AST) or equivalent parsed representation of the original file versus the modified file.
  - Ignoring changes to whitespace, comments, formatting, or superficial renaming of identifiers.
  - Counting changes that **alter control flow, data structures, or implemented algorithms** as functional modifications.
- Attribution is optional when the threshold of significant modification is met, but remains encouraged.


3. Licensing Condition (Strong Copyleft)
----------------------------------------
- This software and all derivative works must **always remain licensed under the Authentic Open License (AOL)**.
- Relicensing under any other license (including MIT, GPL, Apache, BSD, proprietary, or closed-source)
  is strictly prohibited.
- AOL ensures that this software and all derivatives remain free and open forever.

4. Prohibited Uses
------------------
This software may not be used for unlawful purposes under applicable law.

5. Warranty Disclaimer
----------------------
This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
The authors shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, or claims arising from the use of this software.

6. Acceptance
--------------
By obtaining, using, modifying, or distributing this software, you accept the terms of the Authentic Open License (AOL).
